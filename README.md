Introduction -

I've developed a personal website to use as a way to showcase my skills as a fullstack developer. It's a WIP, and I'm always open to suggestions. Please feel free to use my project to build your own website if you wish!

Here's a link to my live website - https://website-ten-nu-83.vercel.app/

Getting Started -

Clone the repo, install the dependencies ("npm install") and run the project using "npm run dev".


Work to be done -

I need to clean up the code, make my mail-adress interactable and make the portfolio stand out a bit more.
